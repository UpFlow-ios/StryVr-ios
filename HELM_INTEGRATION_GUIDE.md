## üö® **Important Notes**

### **Security**
- **Never commit** App Store Connect private keys to git
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
- **Rotate keys regularly** for production security

### **Best Practices**
- **Version control** all Helm configurations
- **Test thoroughly** before production deployment
- **Monitor deployments** for any issues
- **Backup configurations** regularly

### **StryVr-Specific Considerations**
- **HR verification features** require special App Store review notes
- **ClearMe integration** needs privacy policy updates
- **Okta enterprise features** require enterprise app review
- **Liquid Glass UI** should be showcased in screenshots
