Your `Info.plist` file looks well-structured and includes all necessary keys for the described functionalities. However, here are a few suggestions to ensure completeness and clarity:

1. **Privacy - Location Always and When In Use Usage Descriptions**: Ensure that both descriptions are clear and distinct.
2. **Background Modes**: Verify that all background modes are necessary and used appropriately to avoid app rejection during the review process.
3. **Firebase Configuration**: Ensure that the Firebase configuration is correctly set up in your project.

Here is the updated `Info.plist` with minor adjustments for clarity:
