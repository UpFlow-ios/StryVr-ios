# 💬 StryVr Slack Integration Guide

## 🎯 **Overview**

Professional Slack integration for the StryVr iOS development workflow, providing real-time notifications for CI/CD, deployments, security alerts, and development milestones.

## ✅ **What's Integrated**

### **📋 Notification Categories:**

### **📢 Slack Channels:**
- `#stryvr-ci` - CI/CD pipeline notifications
- `#stryvr-deployment` - Deployment and App Store updates
- `#stryvr-security` - Security alerts and monitoring
- `#stryvr-dev` - General development updates

## 🚀 **Quick Setup**

### **Step 1: Create Slack Channels**
```bash
# Create these channels in your Slack workspace:
#stryvr-ci
#stryvr-deployment  
#stryvr-security
#stryvr-dev
```

### **Step 2: Set Up Slack App & Webhooks**
1. Go to [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click **"Create New App"** → **"From scratch"**
3. Name: **"StryVr Bot"**

5. Go to **"Incoming Webhooks"** → **"Activate Incoming Webhooks"**
6. Click **"Add New Webhook to Workspace"** for each channel
7. Copy all webhook URLs

### **Step 3: Configure StryVr Integration**
```bash
# Run the setup script
npm run slack:setup

# OR manually:
./Scripts/slack_integration.sh setup
```

### **Step 4: Test Integration**
```bash
# Test all channels
npm run slack:test

# OR manually:
./Scripts/slack_integration.sh test
```

## 🔧 **Advanced Configuration**

### **Manual Configuration**
If you prefer manual setup, create `.slack_config.json`:

```json
{
    "webhooks": {
        "ci_cd": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/CI/WEBHOOK",
        "deployment": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/DEPLOY/WEBHOOK", 
        "security": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SECURITY/WEBHOOK",
        "general": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/GENERAL/WEBHOOK"
    },
    "channels": {
        "ci_cd": "stryvr-ci",
        "deployment": "stryvr-deployment",
        "security": "stryvr-security", 
        "general": "stryvr-dev"
    }
}
```

### **Custom Notifications**
Send custom notifications using the CLI:

```bash
# CI/CD Notifications
./Scripts/slack_integration.sh ci "success" "Custom success message"
./Scripts/slack_integration.sh ci "failure" "Custom failure message"

# Deployment Notifications  
./Scripts/slack_integration.sh deploy "TestFlight" "successful" "v1.0.0"
./Scripts/slack_integration.sh deploy "App Store" "submitted" "v1.0.0"

# Security Notifications
./Scripts/slack_integration.sh security "Vulnerability" "critical" "CVE-2024-1234"
./Scripts/slack_integration.sh security "Scan Complete" "low" "All clear"

# Development Notifications
./Scripts/slack_integration.sh dev "Feature Complete" "New Liquid Glass UI"

./Scripts/slack_integration.sh appstore "Approval" "success" "Ready for release!"
```

## 🤖 **Automated Triggers**

### **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
The GitHub Actions workflow automatically sends notifications for:

- **Pipeline Start** - When CI/CD begins
- **Quality Checks** - SwiftLint, tests, build status
- **Security Scans** - Dependency vulnerability results
- **Pipeline Complete** - Success or failure with details

### **Development Workflow Integration**
Notifications are sent for:

- **Pull Request Events** - Opened, merged, closed
- **Release Milestones** - Version tags, feature completions
- **Security Events** - Vulnerability detection, secret scanning
- **Deployment Events** - TestFlight uploads, App Store submissions

## 🔐 **Security Best Practices**

### **Webhook Security**
- ✅ Use HTTPS webhooks only
- ✅ Keep webhook URLs private (add to `.gitignore`)
- ✅ Rotate webhooks periodically
- ✅ Use minimal Slack permissions

### **Configuration Security**
```bash
# Add to .gitignore
echo ".slack_config.json" >> .gitignore

# Secure file permissions
chmod 600 .slack_config.json
```

### **Environment Variables Alternative**
For production environments, use environment variables:

```bash
export SLACK_CI_WEBHOOK="https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
export SLACK_DEPLOY_WEBHOOK="https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
export SLACK_SECURITY_WEBHOOK="https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
export SLACK_GENERAL_WEBHOOK="https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
```
