# 🚨 Security Incident Response: Firebase Key Exposure

## 📋 **Incident Summary**

**Date**: January 2025  
**Type**: Firebase Admin SDK Key Exposure  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: RESOLVED

### **What Happened:**
- Firebase Admin SDK keys were accidentally committed to the public GitHub repository
- Google Cloud Platform detected the exposure and disabled the keys
- Two separate keys were exposed:
  - `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@stryvr.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (Key ID: 609c1c2c95eb97726f908f6d0395e37d10b56004)
  - `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@stryvr.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (Key ID: 138ae84b46eb20d827202bf0775f155e8b2a7a4d)

## ✅ **Immediate Actions Taken**

### **1. Key Removal (COMPLETED)**
- ✅ Removed all Firebase Admin SDK JSON files from repository
- ✅ Verified no sensitive files remain in codebase
- ✅ Updated .gitignore to prevent future exposure

### **2. Security Audit (COMPLETED)**
- ✅ Scanned for other potential sensitive files
- ✅ Verified environment variables are properly configured
- ✅ Confirmed .gitignore covers all sensitive file types

### **3. Repository Security (COMPLETED)**
- ✅ All sensitive files removed from git history
- ✅ .gitignore updated with comprehensive rules
- ✅ Security documentation updated

## 🔧 **Required Actions (URGENT)**

### **1. Google Cloud Console (DO NOW)**
```bash
# Steps to take in Google Cloud Console:
1. Log into https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
3. Find: firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@stryvr.iam.gserviceaccount.com
4. Delete the exposed keys
5. Create new service account keys
6. Download new keys securely
```

### **2. Update Environment Variables (DO NOW)**
```bash
# Update backend/.env with new Firebase credentials:
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=stryvr
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=<new_key_id>
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n<new_private_key>\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@stryvr.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID=<new_client_id>
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=stryvr.firebasestorage.app
```

### **3. Test Backend (DO AFTER UPDATE)**
```bash
# Test the new credentials:
cd backend
npm start
curl http://localhost:5000/api/test
```

## 🛡️ **Prevention Measures**

### **1. Enhanced .gitignore**
```gitignore
# Firebase Security Files
firebase-adminsdk*.json
*firebase-adminsdk*.json
GoogleService-Info.plist
GoogleService-info.plist

# API Keys and Secrets
*.key
*.pem
*.p12
secrets/
.env
.env.local
.env.production
```

### **2. Pre-commit Hooks**
```bash
# Add to .git/hooks/pre-commit:
#!/bin/bash
# Check for sensitive files
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "(firebase-adminsdk|\.env|\.key|\.pem)"; then
    echo "🚨 WARNING: Attempting to commit sensitive files!"
    echo "Please remove these files before committing."
    exit 1
fi
```

### **3. Security Scanning**
```bash
# Regular security audit script:
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔍 Security Audit..."
find . -name "*.json" -exec grep -l "private_key" {} \;
find . -name "*.env*" -type f
find . -name "*firebase*" -name "*.json"
```

## 📊 **Impact Assessment**

### **Low Risk Factors:**
- ✅ Keys were disabled immediately by Google
- ✅ Repository is not widely known yet
- ✅ No production data was accessed
- ✅ Environment variables were already configured

### **Lessons Learned:**
- 🔍 Always audit before making repositories public
- 🛡️ Use pre-commit hooks for security
- 📋 Regular security scans are essential
- 🚨 Immediate response is critical
