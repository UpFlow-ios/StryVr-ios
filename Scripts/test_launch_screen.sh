echo "🎯 What to Look For:"
echo "- Launch screen appears immediately when app starts"
echo "- Background matches StryVr's dark theme"
echo "- Logo container has glass effect"
echo "- App name 'StryVr' is visible"
echo "- Tagline 'AI-Powered Professional Development' is visible"
echo "- Loading indicator is spinning"
echo "- Smooth transition to main app"

echo "🚨 Common Issues:"
echo "- Launch screen not showing: Check Info.plist and project settings"
echo "- Black screen: Verify background color in storyboard"
echo "- Layout issues: Test on different device sizes"
